# Resource Tracker 

> I wanted to practice entity framework to gain a better understadning. I built a small resourse tracking system. For this project I chose to build an application that can track student records.

## What did I learn?
- How to set up an Entity Framework Project
- How to Configure an EF project
- I gained a better understanding of Entity Framework work flow
- How DB migrations work and the purpose of them
